This project does an empirical complexity analysis of different search algorithms. The algorithms studied are:
* Linear search
* Binary search (both iterative and recursive versions)
* Ternary search (both iterative and recursive versions)     
* Jump search
* Fibonacci search

--------------------------------------------------

The goals of this project are:
1. Determine which of the two linear search algorithms (linear or jump search) is more efficient in the worst case.
2. Which implementation is more efficient: recursive or iterative? (Comparison between iterative and recursive versions.)
3. How the partition size influence in the search performace? (Comparison between iterative binary, iterative ternary and Fibonacci searches.)
4. From what moment different complexity classes begin to differ? (Comparison between linear and iterative binary search.)
5. Are there different worst case categories for the Fibonacci search? (comparison between two worst case of Fibonacci search.)
